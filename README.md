This package is designed to be deployed on [UDS Core](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-core), and is based on the upstream [Confluence](https://github.com/jfrog/charts/tree/master/stable/confluence) chart.

## Pre-requisites

The Confluence Package expects to be deployed on top of [UDS Core](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-core) with the dependencies listed below being configured prior to deployment.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **NOTE**: Many features are locked behind a license. Some notable features include:
> - In place upgrades
> - Single sign-on capabilities

Confluence is configured by default to assume the internal dependencies that are used for testing (see postgres in the [bundle](bundle/uds-bundle.yaml)).

#### Database

- A Postgres database is running on port `5432` and accessible to the cluster via the `CONFLUENCE_DB_ENDPOINT` Zarf var.
- This database can be logged into via the username configured with the Zarf var `CONFLUENCE_DB_USERNAME`. Default is `confluence.confluence`
- This database instance has a psql database created matching what is defined in the Zarf var `CONFLUENCE_DB_NAME`. Default is `confluencedb`
- The user has read/write access to the above mentioned database
- Create `confluence-postgres` service in `confluence` namespace that points to the psql database
- Create `confluence-postgres` secret in `confluence` namespace with the key `password` that contains the password to the user for the psql database

## Flavors

| Flavor | Description | Example Creation |
| ------ | ----------- | ---------------- |
| registry1 | Uses images from registry1.dso.mil within the package. | `zarf package create . -f registry1` |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **NOTE:** To create the registry1 flavor you will need to be logged into Iron Bank - you can find instructions on how to do this in the [Big Bang Zarf Tutorial](https://docs.zarf.dev/tutorials/6-big-bang/#setup).
